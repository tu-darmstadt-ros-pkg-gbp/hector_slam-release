%description
hector_mapping is a SLAM approach that can be used without odometry as well as
on platforms that exhibit roll/pitch motion (of the sensor, the platform or
both). It leverages the high update rate of modern LIDAR systems like the Hokuyo
UTM-30LX and provides 2D pose estimates at scan rate of the sensors (40Hz for
the UTM-30LX). While the system does not provide explicit loop closing ability,
it is sufficiently accurate for many real world scenarios. The system has
successfully been used on Unmanned Ground Robots, Unmanned Surface Vehicles,
Handheld Mapping Devices and logged data from quadrotor UAVs.
